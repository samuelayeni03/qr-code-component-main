### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
-CSS


### What I learned

I learned and still learning more about writing semantic html and css.

I also learned more about flex and importing fonts.

```css
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;




### Continued development

I want to focus on practising CSS in general because it's a bit difficult for me.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXGznpKZ_sA&t=3s) - This is a CSS course by Dave Gray published on
 freecodecamp.org. This video really helped me.
